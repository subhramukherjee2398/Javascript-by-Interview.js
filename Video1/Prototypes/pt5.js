/* Classical I heritence vs protoTypal Inheritence */

/* 
classical Imheritence : 
Class is the blue print and by using the class we can create objts that imherit proprty and methods from the class
And there are also hybrid inheritence that means two derived class can inherit from the base class.
*/

/*
ProtoTypal Inheritencr
But in javascript inheritence is like a straight chain and the object and inherit method from it's one level top Object.Basically cloing the object.
